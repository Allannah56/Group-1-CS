            I'm 18 years old and I have two silbings. <br>
            I have a twin sister and an older brother. I was born in Ecuador but moved to the United States when I was 3 years old. <br>
            I like to play sports for fun. <br>
            Such as volleyball, tennis, swim and bike ride. I also like to draw and sketch.
